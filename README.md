# Mitchum Demo Code

This repository contains some test code I created for the new design of  [mitchum.com](http://mitchum.com "Visit mitchum.com"). The site had a status of "coming soon" when I created this repo so this code represents just my playing around with things so I could get a head-start on developing the site.

I can't show the final production code in a completly public repo, regardless of whether or not it's open source. But the code in this repo is pretty close.  It's well-commented but feel free to ask me any questions you may have about it.
